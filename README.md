# Getting to Philosophy
This program crawls Wikipedia pages to reach Philosophy page

Getting to Philosophy:
Clicking on the first link in the main text of an English Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually leads to the Philosophy article.
In February 2016, this was true for 97% of all articles in Wikipedia[1], an increase from 94.52% in 2011.
The remaining articles lead to an article without any outgoing wikilinks, to pages that do not exist, or get stuck in loops.

Following the chain consists of:
Clicking on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link
Ignoring external links, links to the current page, or red links (links to non-existent pages)
Stopping when reaching "Philosophy", a page with no links or a page that does not exist, or when a loop occurs

About Program: 
This program takes a Wikipedia page link and goes to the first link in the main text until it reaches to Philosophy page.
The program displays the title of the first link on the page and to the link.
The Program also shows how many jumps are needed to reach the end.
